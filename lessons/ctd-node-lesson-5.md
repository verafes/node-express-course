Watch the “CodingAddict – Build 4 Node/Express Projects” video **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rltfdjcXjmk)**. This lesson is on the first 1:28:45 of the video; next session’s lesson 6 will start with the section on validation.

In this lesson and in several that follow, **you duplicate the work of the instructor**, testing as you go with Postman. Since you will be building and testing as you watch, read through the Coding Assignment section below _**before**_ starting the video.
